Description of Working Group
----------------------------

OpenPGP is an Internet standard that covers object encryption, object
signing, and identity certification.  These were defined by the first
incarnation of the OpenPGP working group.

The following is an excerpt from the charter of the original
incarnation of the openpgp working group

> The goal of the OpenPGP working group is to provide IETF standards
> for the algorithms and formats of PGP processed objects as well as
> providing the MIME framework for exchanging them via e-mail or other
> transport protocols.

The working group concluded this work and was closed in March
of 2008.  In the intervening period, there has been a rough consensus
reached that the RFC that defined the IETF openpgp standard, RFC4880,
is in need of revision.

This incarnation of the working group is chartered to primarily
produce a revision of RFC4880 to address issues that have been
identified by the community since the working group was originally
closed.

The Working Group will perform the following work
-------------------------------------------------

Revise RFC4880

Other work may be entertained by the working group as long as it does
not interfere with the completion of the RFC4880 revision.  As the
revision of RFC4880 is primary goal of the working group, and other
work will also not unduly delay the closure of the working group
after the revision is finished (unless the working group is
rechartered).

Working Group Process
---------------------

The working group will endeavor to complete most if not all of its
work online on the working group's mailing list.  We expect that the
requirement for face-to-face sessions at IETF meetings to be minimal.

Furthermore, the working group will accept no ID's as working group
items unless there is a review by at least two un-interested parties
of the ID as part of the acceptance process.


Goals and Milestones
--------------------

July 2016: Deliver an RFC 4880bis WG ID to the RFC editor
